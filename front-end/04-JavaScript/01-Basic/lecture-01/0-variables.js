// there are 3 ways of declaring variables in js 
// 1. let , 2. var & 3. Const 

let x =2 ;
console.log(x);
x=4;
console.log(x);

var y =5 ;
console.log(y);
y= 6 ;
console.log(y);

const z = 9 ;
console.log(z);
// we cannot change the value of a constant variable once it is assigned . If you try to do so an error will be thrown by JS engine .
// z = 8; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
// trying to change the value of const will give an error
